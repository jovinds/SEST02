          <h2>How to Cook</h2> <br>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              Begin by washing pork spare ribs in cold running water to remove
              any visible impurities. Then, place pork ribs submerge in a medium
              pot with a liter of water. Bring to a boil without covering the
              pot and allow the scum to float to the surface. Meticulously
              remove the scums from the surface of the water using a slotted
              spoon or a spatula. Scums are impurities found in meat.
            </li>
            <li>
              After the broth clears up, turn you heat to medium setting, then
              it’s time toss in your onions and tomatoes to add flavor to the
              broth. Cover your pot and let it simmer to fully cook your meat.
              Use a fork to pierce the meat so that the flavors would also enter
              the meaty parts of the spare ribs, You also do this so you can
              tell if it’s already set and tender.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can already add your vegetables. Start by adding the sitaw,
              kangkong stalks and talong into the pot and cook until these turn
              dark green. If you decide to use labanos and okra, you can also
              add those at this point. This should take roughly around 2-3
              minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add in your siling sigang, kangkong leaves and the Knorr Sinigang
              sa Sampaloc Mix. Stir and let it simmer. It should be done in
              about 2-3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              All done! Transfer your Sinigang to a serving bowl. This is a
              happy treat that warms, soothes and satisfies everyone in the
              family! Remember to prepare extra servings of rice to enjoy the
              extra asim kilig taste of this Filipino classic soup. Enjoy!
